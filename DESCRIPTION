Description: Data package containing shapefiles for the US that may easily be restricted to only
    the contiguous US. Shapefiles are provided for; states, congressional districts and counties.
    All shapefiles have the resolution of 1:20,000,000 and are from the US Census Bureau -
    <https://www.census.gov/geo/maps-data/data/tiger-cart-boundary.html>. State/County/District 
    information has been combined from multiple disjoint Census shapefile products in this package, 
    see the 'shapefile_details' tibble for details. Please note, this package is explicitly designed to 
    fit all shapefiles within one CRAN-hosted package. You will want to use the 'tigris' package 
    for programmatic access to the US Census' shapefile products.
